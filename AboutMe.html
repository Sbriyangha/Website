                <p class="lead"> ‘’Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don’t think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without the talking about the other.’’ - Bill Gates </p>



<p> The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be create. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn things they didn’t think they could learn before and so in a sense it is all about potential. This was the potential I saw in Business Information Technology when choosing courses when I came to university. 

My name is Briyangha, or better known as Brie (Yes, the cheese). I am a Sri Lankan native born in France and bought up in England. 

I am a proactive and versatile student currently studying Business Information Technology at Coventry University. I have a passion for business analysis planning, problem analysis, project management and innovating solutions under a business environment. 

My passion for IT blossomed when I was I was in year 9. The very basic software we used such as Dreamweaver and scratch encourage me to follow up on this field. My passion for IT grew as I furthered my study into A-Levels.  ICT A-level was a revolution to me. The passion I had for IT integrated with the passion I had for business which resulted in me choosing the course I study today, Business Information Technology. 

Business Information Technology is a course which prepares you for meeting challenges in a working environment by teaching you fundamental elements of both business and IT. Today’s businesses are faced with the challenges of global competition and technological change.

Developing analytical, numerical and problem solving skills can lead me to secure employment at prosperous organizations. The effective use of business information technology is crucial to every modern business and profession, and experts in this field are in demand.

<h2>Other Interests</h2>
<p> Since I can remember myself I was passionate about traveling. The experience of new cultures, new opinions, history, ideas, scenery and the food, like it’s an adventure. 
for me travelling is about learning about somebody and something else, it’s about broadening my mind and being more open to experiences & ideas.
Once I turned 18 my parents fulfilled my dreams and took me to a few countries I could only dream of seeing. Below are some photos of what I saw in all these exciting countries. </p>
